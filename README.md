# K-Mean-Clustering

## 🧠 What is K-Means Clustering?

K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data points into K distinct clusters based on similarity.

Each cluster has a center (centroid). The goal of the algorithm is to:

Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.

Update centroids as the average of the points in the cluster.

Repeat until convergence (no major changes in centroids).

## 📌 Real-World Example Applications:

| Use Case                    | Explanation                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Customer Segmentation**   | Group customers based on buying behavior.        |
| **Image Compression**       | Group similar pixel colors to reduce image size. |
| **Market Segmentation**     | Cluster regions by income, spending, etc.        |
| **Document Classification** | Group documents/articles by topic.               |
| **Anomaly Detection**       | Detect points that don't belong to any cluster.  |

## Choosing the Right Number of Clusters (K)

You can use the Elbow Method to decide, The Elbow Method is a technique used to find the optimal number of clusters (K) for your K-Means algorithm.


## ❓Why Do We Need the Elbow Method?

When you apply K-Means, you must choose K, the number of clusters. But how do you know what value of K is best?

If you choose:

Too small K → clusters will be too broad and miss important patterns.

Too large K → clusters will be too narrow or meaningless.

The Elbow Method helps you pick the best K, where adding more clusters doesn’t significantly improve the model.

✅ Best K: 5

💡 Why K=5?

At K=5, the curve starts to flatten, meaning adding more clusters doesn't reduce inertia much.

Before K=5, each added cluster dramatically reduces inertia.

After K=5, the improvement becomes small (diminishing returns).

## Dataset:

We'll use the popular Mall Customer Segmentation dataset. It contains customer details like:

CustomerID

Gender

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1-100)

We'll cluster customers into groups based on their income and spending behavior.

## 📌 What K-Means Helps You Discover:

| Cluster Type                  | Description                            | What You Can Do                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
|  Low Income, Low Spending     | Likely budget-conscious or cautious    | Send discounts, low-cost offers              |
|  High Income, Low Spending    | Wealthy but not engaged                | Target with premium ads, loyalty programs    |
|  Low Income, High Spending    | Engaged but might need budgeting tools | Offer savings plans, or personalized deals   |
|  High Income, High Spending   | Ideal customers                        | VIP offers, exclusive deals, keep them loyal |
